I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.uwindsor.ca/science/computerscience/), University of Windsor, Canada. Before that, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Lakehead University, Canada.

I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab](http://sail.cs.queensu.ca) (SAIL) at Queen's University, Canada where I worked with Prof. [Ahmed E. Hassan](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/ahmed/home) (IEEE Fellow). I completed my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.usask.ca/), University of Saskatchewan, in February 2018. I was part of the [Software Research Lab](http://www.cs.usask.ca/research/research_groups/selab/) and worked with [Dr. Chanchal Roy](http://www.cs.usask.ca/~croy/)Â and [Dr. Kevin A. Schneider](http://www.cs.usask.ca/grads/kas/Welcome.html).

My research facilitates software development activities by mining source code repositories, community question-answering sites, and online tutorials. To this end, I leverage static analysis, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop solutions. I believe that careful investigation and analysis are the keys to developing state-of-the-art tools and techniques. Thus, my research is a blend of empirical theories and their associated tools to support software development tasks and to increase the productivity of developers.

I am interested in empirical studies, software maintenance and evolution, mining software repositories, program comprehension, web information retrieval, and recommendation systems in software engineering.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
